"""
This module contains tasks of the D-Bus service.

A task - Task subclass - performs actual work such as manipulating files.
Tasks run in threads so as not to block communication with the service
process. All installation and configuration jobs must be represented as Tasks.

Tasks can be used in multiple situations. Generally there are three kinds
of tasks:
  * Configuration task - runs at start on installation.
  * Installation task - runs at end of installation.
  * Calculation task - runs whenever code makes it run.

The difference between the three kinds is where they come from - configuration
and installation tasks are returned by specific methods in the service's main
class, so they are run at pre-defined times.

Every kind of task has the run() method that performs the actual work.
